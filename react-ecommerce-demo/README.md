**Overview**
This project implements a small online shop interface including:

- Product listing
- Cart management
- Shipment and contact forms
- Order review and submit flow

State is managed via React Context API, data fetching is encapsulated in custom hooks, and styling is handled with SCSS and CSS Modules.

**Core Features**

- Product list with add-to-cart and quantity control
- Centralized cart state using Context API
- Shipment and contact forms with validation
- Region and country lookup logic
- Order summary page with calculated totals
- Modular styling architecture (SCSS base + CSS Modules)
- Provider pattern for scalable state handling
- Responsive layout suitable for production UI

**Architecture Highlights**

- Context-based state management (CartProvider, ProductProvider, ProgressProvider)
- Custom data hooks (useProductsApi, useCountriesApi, useRegionsApi)
- API abstraction layer in src/api/
- Validation utilities separated from UI logic
- Clear folder separation by responsibility
